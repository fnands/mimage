*Not pure Mojo yet, but hopefully soon.
## About The Project

Mimage is a image manipulation library loosely based on Python's [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow). The goal is to be able to read and write the most popular image formats directly from Mojo.

## Quick Start

Basic usage:

```mojo
import mimage as mi

def main():

  tensor = mi.imread("my/png/image.png")

```

Try out the tests yourself:

```sh
mojo -I .  tests/test_open_png.mojo
```

## Roadmap

### v0.1.0 âœ…
- [x] Read simple 8-bit PNGs

### Near term
- [ ] Read jpegs

### Medium term
- [ ] Read more complex PNGs
- [ ] Write PNGs
- [ ] Write jpegs

### Long term
- [ ] v1.0.0 will be achieved when Mimage can open all the same images as Pillow.

## About The Project

Mimage is a image manipulation library loosely based on Python's [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow). The goal is to be able to read and write the most popular image formats directly from Mojo.

## Quick Start

Try out the benchmarks yourself:

```
mojo -I .  tests/test_open_png.mojo
```


## Roadmap

### v0.1.0 ✅
- [x] Read simple 8-bit PNGs

### Near term
- [ ] Read jpegs

### Medium term
- [ ] Read more complex PNGs
- [ ] Write PNGs
- [ ] Write jpegs

### Long term
- [ ] v1.0.0 will be achieved when Mimage can open all the same images as Pillow.
